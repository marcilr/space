World Space Week begins - October 4


World Space Week begins
For the start of World Space Week, today's homepage features 
a composite of images taken by NASA's Juno probe as it swooped 
past Jupiter.  The largest planet in our solar system, Jupiter 
also has the largest number of moons: 79.  Jupiter is the Roman 
counterpart to Zeus, and the planet's major moons are named 
after Zeus', shall we say, extra-marital partners.  So, when it 
came time to name NASA's most ambitious Jupiter probe, they 
decided to name it after Jupiterâ€™s wife, Juno, so that she could 
keep an eye on him. Every 53 days in the course of its wide and 
complex orbit, the Juno probe makes its closest approach, snapping 
shots like these as it speeds past the gas giant in just two hours. 
World Space Week starts on the anniversary of the launch of the 
very first space probe, Sputnik, which entered orbit around the 
Earth on October 4, 1957.
