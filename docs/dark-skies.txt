Dark Skies


"Light pollution is a continuous reality for many cities around
the world.  The use of artificial lighting during the night has
led to disruptions in the nocturnal environment.  These
disruptions cause problems for plants, animals, and even humans
by interfering with the natural night-day cycle. With rising
awareness on the importance of a dark sky in the night,
astronauts and national organizations have created areas away
from interference by artificial light called dark sky parks.
These areas exist in categories such as communities, reserves
preserves, and sanctuaries.  Dark sky parks help astronomers
in studying the night skies and for stargazers who wish to
enjoy the night skies.  There are over 60 dark sky parks,
communities, and reserves in the United States located in
various states as designated by the International Dark-Sky
Association."
